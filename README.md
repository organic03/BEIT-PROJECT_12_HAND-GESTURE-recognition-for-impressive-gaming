# Hand Gesture Recognition for Immersive gaming                           




Over the recent years, Computer Vision has started to play a significant role in Human 
Computer Interaction. With the development of information technology in our society, we can 
expect that computer systems will be embedded into our environment. These environments 
will impose needs for new types of human-computer-interaction, with interfaces that are 
natural and easy to use. The ability to interact with computerized equipment without need for 
special external equipment is attractive. With efficient use of available resources, it is possible 
to track motion of human hand and fingers in real time using a simple web camera. The aim of 
this project is to enhance the level of immersion in computer games by creating an application 
that will allow users to interact with the game only using their hands. The proposed 
application will enable the user to play computer games without the need of either a keyboard 
or a mouse or any other expensive input devices. The users can play games through various 
gestures done using only their hands. This is the main background of the project. Therefore, 
the project aims in replacing the traditional mouse and touch pads with human hand (fingers) 
to interact with games which would allow more immersion of users and is also cheap to 
implement.
